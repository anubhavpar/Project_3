# Metis Project 3 
Project 3 in the Metis Data Science Bootcamp

Problem statement: 

Based on given set of information, predict if the individual will get vaccinated for H1N1 and Seasonal Flu. The features analyzed are broadly classified into three categories:

* Background 
* Opinion 
* Behavioural 

I applied various classification algorithms, and I found that tree-based models like XGBoost as well as Logistic Regression performed the best.

Due to its interpretability and ability to quantitatively translate the inputs to the output, I deployed the Logistic Regression model. My model was biased towards a higher recall as I wanted to capture as many positive scenarios and a loss of precision was not a huge concern for me.
